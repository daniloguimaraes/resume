# resume

It's just my resume


### What is it made of?

It's a React web application, created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) tool.

Additionally, was added [react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next) component to provide the internalionalizaion feature.

### I like it. How can I make my own resumé?

I prepared a simple Wiki page to help you adapting this project and publishing your own Github Page resumé.

### I don't like it

Please, [let me know why](https://github.com/daniloguimaraes/resume/issues/new).
